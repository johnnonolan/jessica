h1. Jessica

_A micro web framework written out of curiosity in .NET, inspired by Ruby's Sinatra._

h2. Micro Web Framework

Jessica's interpretation of a _micro web framework_ is as follows:

* Framework for creating web application that only provides a minimum feature set
* Provides the least required set of helpers
* Uses a simple pattern for creating actions/routes for the application
* Nonessential features provided as third-party extensions

Jessica aims to become a feature equivalent of Sinatra for .NET. Jessica follows three simple rules:

* Simple Configuration
* Simple Conventions
* Simple Code

h2. Installing

If you would like to use the Jessica micro web framework you can install it via the NuGet package manager.
